# TypeConjunctionDispatchPrototype
This is a very brittle and rough prototype transpiler to regular Javascript from a variant of Javascript extended with a very limited form of dynamic dispatching via ‘guard’ tests and type conjunctions

The `tagJsConverter.mjs` file contains all the stuff to make it work. See the `tagJsTests.mjs` file for examples. Run the `tagJsTests.mjs` file in node for automatic tests

See the [github page here](https://jmacc93.github.io/TypeConjunctionDispatchPrototype/) to see it in action
